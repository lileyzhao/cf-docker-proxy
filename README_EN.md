[‰∏≠Êñá](README.md) | English

A Docker registry proxy service built on Cloudflare Workers that provides accelerated access to Docker images from multiple registries including Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, Google Container Registry, Kubernetes Registry, and Quay.io.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Risk Warning

**Please carefully read and understand the following risk warning:**

Cloudflare updated its [Terms of Service](https://www.cloudflare.com/terms/) on December 3, 2024, explicitly stating that using their services as a proxy is prohibited. According to the restrictions in section 2.2.1 of the terms, using Cloudflare services as a proxy may be considered a violation of the terms of service and could result in account suspension.

**This project is intended for learning and technical research purposes only. Please use it cautiously after understanding the associated risks. If you choose to deploy this project, please remove the Cloudflare deployment within 24 hours.**

## Why This Project

**Single domain for multiple registries**: Unlike other proxies that require different domains for each registry, this project supports all mainstream image registries with just one domain.

## Features

- üîó Single domain supports all registries
- üåê Support for multiple registries (Docker Hub, ghcr.io, gcr.io, k8s.io, quay.io)
- üöÄ Fast image pulling through Cloudflare's global edge network

## Deploy

### Quick Deploy (Recommended)

[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/lileyzhao/cf-docker-proxy)

1. Click the "Deploy With Workers" button above
2. Sign in to your Cloudflare account
3. Fork the repository to your GitHub account
4. Connect your GitHub repository to Cloudflare Workers
5. Configure your custom domain (optional) in the Cloudflare dashboard
6. The worker will be deployed automatically

### Manual Deploy

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lileyzhao/cf-docker-proxy.git
   cd cf-docker-proxy
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Deploy to Cloudflare Workers:

   ```bash
   pnpm run deploy
   ```

### Usage

After deployment, you can use your Docker proxy by setting it as your Docker registry mirror:

```bash
# Docker Hub (Simplified)
docker pull your-worker-domain.workers.dev/hello-world

# Docker Hub (Full Path)
docker pull your-worker-domain.workers.dev/docker.io/hello-world

# GitHub Registry
docker pull your-worker-domain.workers.dev/ghcr.io/distroless/static

# Google Registry
docker pull your-worker-domain.workers.dev/gcr.io/google-containers/pause

# Kubernetes Registry
docker pull your-worker-domain.workers.dev/k8s.io/pause

# Quay.io
docker pull your-worker-domain.workers.dev/quay.io/prometheus/node-exporter
```

Replace `your-worker-domain.workers.dev` with your actual Cloudflare Workers domain.
